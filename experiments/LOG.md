# Experiment log: local SLM review

Iterating on how the extension's custom-label scan prompts and drives its
small local models. Tool: `npm run lab` (src/lab/), which renders each request
exactly like the extension ref (parity-checked) and varies one thing at a time
(src/lab/configs.ts). Scoring: the ref's own parser and anchoring, then the
bench scorer (overlap P/R/F1 at passage level, case detection, false-positive
rate on negatives, format compliance, failure modes).

- Iteration set: `experiments/sets/iter32.json` (32 dev cases, 22 positive, 10
  negative, 16 EN / 16 FR). The held-out test split is never used.
- Extension ref: `main` @ dc91f36 (line protocol, PR #17) unless noted.
- Runtime: onnxruntime-web WASM, 4 threads, greedy, one model process at a time.
- Columns: F1o/P/R = overlap F1, precision, recall (%), F1x = exact F1, det =
  positive cases detected, FPR = negatives with a false finding, comp = format
  compliance, p50s = median latency (s), tok = mean generated tokens.
- Per-case outputs of every run: `experiments/runs/<name>.json`.

### E0. Lab parity with the extension engine

Ran the ref's own `SlmEngine` + `reviewPrompt` and the lab's `ref`
configuration on 5 iter32 cases with SmolLM2-135M: 5/5 raw outputs identical
(`src/lab/parity.ts`). The lab reproduces the extension exactly, so every
other configuration differs from the shipped behaviour only by its overrides.

### E1. Baseline, SmolLM2-135M (extension default model)

| config | F1o | P | R | F1x | det | FPR | comp | p50s | tok | failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ref | 5 | 33 | 3 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 34 | 5.6 | 123 | timeout 2, echo 3, echo_instructions 22, answered 5 |

The shipped default model mostly recites the label list back (22/32) instead
of scanning. Run: `smol135-ref`.

### E2. First hypotheses on SmolLM2-135M

One change at a time from `ref` (definitions in `src/lab/configs.ts`). Run `e2-smol135`.

| config | F1o | P | R | F1x | det | FPR | comp | p50s | tok | failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ref | 5 | 33 | 3 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 34 | 5.6 | 123 | timeout 2, echo 3, echoI 22, answered 5 |
| rp1 | 5 | 33 | 3 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 34 | 5.9 | 122 | same as ref (SmolLM2 has no default penalty) |
| strict | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 13 | 5.4 | 125 | echoI 15, answered 9 |
| nobuiltin | 5 | 100 | 3 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 22 | 3.4 | 145 | timeout 5, echoI 10, answered 10 |
| shots-generic | - | - | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 72 | 1.0 | 32 | halluc 16 (copies the demo email) |
| shots-labelex | - | - | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 97 | 0.5 | 2 | always "NONE" (copies the last demo answer) |
| lbl-means | 27 | 50 | 18 | 23 | 23 | 0 | 16 | 5.7 | 120 | echoI 14, answered 7, unkL 3 |
| lbl-quoted | - | - | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5.9 | 133 | echoI 24 |
| order-lis | - | - | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2.5 | 63 | echo 14, answered 16 |
| user-instr | 9 | 40 | 5 | 9 | 9 | 0 | 53 | 6.3 | 116 | echoI 21, answered 8 |
| v4 | 5 | 100 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 28 | 4.6 | 94 | echo 7, echoI 14, answered 10 |

Conclusions:

- SmolLM2-135M cannot do the task with any prompt tried: it recites the label
  list, invents labels, or copies demonstrations verbatim (the last
  few-shot answer, or the demo email). Its best score (lbl-means, 4 of 22
  positives) is within noise at n=32.
- Few-shot as prior chat turns is harmful for this model: it parrots the last
  demo reply instead of reading the text.
- The label list's `- LABEL: description` layout is the line shape the model
  is asked to produce, and it gets recited; changing it (`lbl-means`) was the
  only change that moved recall. Worth retesting on stronger models.
- Next: screen the other bundled models and the candidates
  (experiments/RESEARCH.md) on a few configurations, instead of tuning the
  135M further.
